# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation-in-OS
Simulate CPU scheduling with semaphores in C++. This project creates multiple processes and manages CPU allocation using semaphore synchronization. Experience process execution, CPU availability control, and efficient resource management in an OS-like environment. Ideal for learning and teaching CPU scheduling concepts.
